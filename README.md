# Routing

Small exercise to demonstrate routing with Angular. Dynamic routes can be passed i.e. '/posts/1' and rendered from a single post component. A service is used to share data between components.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
